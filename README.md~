# NewCalc
## Brief Introduction
NewCalc is a calculator which uses expressions as its inputs. Users can input an **expression**. NewCalc can also calculate **long long numbers**. Up to now, it can calculate numbers **no more than 2250 bits**. Also, it can not only calculate integers, but it can also calculate fractions, which means NewCalc can calculate **rational** expressions.

## Class Introduction
### BigNum Class
The BigNum class, also named as Integer, is the main class of the whole program. It uses a vector to store the bits of the number. It contains +, -, * , / and % operators.
### Fraction Class
The Fraction class, also named as Rational, is an extension of the BigNum class. It contains two BigNum classes to represent member and denominator. A little different from the BigNum class, it doesn't support % operator.
### Error Class
The Error class is a class which contains the error type of the expression.
